# Warehouse Wars

This repository contains the original multiplayer implementation and a simple single-player demo that runs entirely in the browser.

## Single Player Demo

Open [index.html](index.html) or enable GitHub Pages on this repository to try the demo online. The demo is a basic HTML and JavaScript recreation that does not require a server.

Use WASD keys or the on-screen arrows to move the player. Avoid the roaming monsters!
